# blipAnanlysisCode
Code for my former analysis of low energy blips in our liquid argon detector.
Most of this work was done in python, although similations were also made using the computing grid.
This project was developed following the work of Avinay, another graduate student working on similar research, and Will F. who worked together with me and other graduate students. 
The goal is to organize and visualize LArTPC data and search for low energy signals in the MeV range.
In particular, an excess of events was found in the 1-3 MeV ranges in certain regions of our detector, called the 'hotspots,' and contamination with gamma ray producing isotopes was suspected and investigated. Plots were made to look for compton edges to identify the likely isotopes behind the excess, and a paper is in the works. 
It has been superceded by more advanced code.
